*WORK IN PROGRESS*


"cyberPUNKED" is a python script that pings all possible IP addresses on a network and reports back both

inside the terminal as well as outputting a text file in the directory it is ran in detailing all of the

devices online it has found on the it is ran on network. Based off of the "Ping" hack found in the

game "Cyberpunk 2077". *DISCLAIMER* Something something ethics something something don't break the law

something something no alphabet bois something something you will be resposnsible for your own actions

something something."


ENJOY!
